# DSBossLore_SuperFan_Project
Created with CodeSandbox
The purpose of this repository is to document the process of designing and getting feedback for my SuperFan Project which tasked me with creating a responsive webpage themed around something I'm a fan of using HTML, CSS, and Javascript in CodeSandbox. I chose to center my website around the videogame Dark Souls and the lore behind its numerous boss encounters.
